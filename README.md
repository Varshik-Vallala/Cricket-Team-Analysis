# Cricket-Team-Analysis
In this end-to-end data analytics project, we have used cricket T20 world cup (2022) data to build insights on a best 11 players team that we can assemble from the earth that can go and play with aliens. I used bright data web scraping to collect data from espncricinfo website then we performed some data transformation and cleaning in pandas, followed by building dashboards in power bi. This is a solid data science project.
